		  <h3>Early Decision (MS1 / MS2)</h3>
		  <ul>
			<li>Get involved in ophthalmology activities, e.g., UB Sight Savers, Ophthalmology Interest Group, and Unite for Sight</li>
			<li>Shadow and ophthalmologist in his or her office and OR, even a few hours can give you an idea of a typical day</li>
			<li>Attend opthalmology grand rounds at the Ross Institute, Thursdays at 7am (September through May). Location: Second floor conference room</li>
			<li>Read about ophthalmology: Good starting point is <a href="http://eyewiki.aao.org">eyewiki.aao.org</a></li>
			<li><strong>Basic Research</strong>: In MS1 and MS2, you have time to get involved in a long-term basic science project. Get in touch with Dr. Steven Fliesler (fliesler@buffalo.edu), Lisa Prince-Baker (lsprince@buffalo.edu), or Dr. Jack Sullivan (jackmsullivanmdphd@yahoo.com).</li>
			<li><strong>Clinical Research</strong>: Clinical studies are also an option, contact Dr. Sandra Sieminski (smfernando17@gmail.com).</li>
			<li>Summer research after MS1 is ideal. Apply for research grants through the university or through outside funding source.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <br>
		  <h3>Later Decision (MS3 / MS4)</h3>
		  <ul><strong>Ophthalmology rotation at home school:</strong>
			<li>Preferably chose a 4 week elective rotation during medicine or surgery during MS3</li>
			<li>Review introductory ophthalmology book (Basic Ophthalmology from AAO provided prior to rotation, contact Elaine Taylor (etaylor@buffalo.edu))</li>
			<li>The rotation can be tailored to observe specific subspecialties. There is opportunity to present at weekly grand rounds during rotation to gain exposure to faculty.</li>
			<li>Contact ophthalmology clerkship director Dr. Sandra Sieminski (smfernando17@gmail.com) to prepare for the rotation</li>
			<li>If you have completed a 4 week MS3 ophthalmology rotation, you may still enroll in an an MS4 ophthalmology rotation if it involves a different experience (for example, cornea/glaucoma in MS3 and retina/pediatrics in MS4)</li>
		  </ul>
		  <ul><strong>Research:</strong>
			<li>Basic science projects will be difficult to initiate and complete, therefore you are usually limited to clinical projects</li>
			<li>Research electives months during 3rd and 4th year can be utilized to complete projects</li>
			<li>Case reports/series are a rapid route to initiate and complete a paper, if time is limited</li>
			<li>If you have not published your data at the time of your application, make sure to list your ongoing projects</li>
			<li>Present poster or paper at a scientific meeting (i.e., AAO or ARVO), if the opportunity arises</li>
		  </ul>
		  <ul><strong>Ophthalmology away rotations:</strong>
			<li>Not required, but usually performed early during MS4</li>
			<li>Important to have some clinical experience prior to the away rotation, as you will have a short time to make an impression on your preceptors</li>
			<li>Typically, the institution provides a courtesy interview</li>
		  </ul>
		  <ul><strong>Letters:</strong>
			<li>3 required, more than 1 from ophthalmologists expected. Other suggested fields include Surgery, medicine, or related subspecialties. Less desirable, but acceptable letters from fields such as Pathology, radiology, or psychiatry</li>
			<li>Ensure that your letter writers know you well, and give them adequate time to prepare a letter</li>
			<li>You may obtain a letter from an away rotation if completed early enough</li>
		  </ul>
